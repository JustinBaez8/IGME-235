                <article>
                    <p><strong>T</strong>he Internet is many things to many people, depending on how you access it
                        and what you want out of it. Seasoned netters tend to feel that they know the net
                        intimately, that they have a finger on the pulse and that nothing moves here
                        without their knowledge. It's an illusion, of course – none of us can get a measure
                        on this particular beast. We may feel movement across the open, rolling plains, see
                        storms gathering in the distance and hear the thunder, but that's about as far as it
                        goes. Rumours are passed our way that this tool will solve that problem, that someone
                        has done a 'really bad thing,' against all accepted protocols, that there'll be a
                        lynching and that the final apocalypse is imminent...

                        Rumours of the death of the Internet are somewhat exaggerated though. To old-timers,
                        mired in RFC and Usenet, commercialisation certaintly will spell the end of their
                        Wild West era – that's if fancy graphical interfaces and America On Line immigrants
                        don't bring it down first. Time is spent exchanging and comparing charts: how much
                        bandwich the Web uses; how many untutored users AOL has unleased; how everyone in the
                        world will be on the Internet by the year 2001. Millenarian fever sweeps through the
                        newsgroups. Strange signs are seen in the archives. Commerce spells evil, although how
                        exactly is not specified.

                        There has been an amazing flowering of commercial invention on the Internet, and it's
                        been gathering pace since the middle of the year, driven by the immediacy of the World
                        Wide Web. Although it's now hard to remember, this time last year there was <em>no</em>
                        World Wide Web, no shapping malls and no on-line sales pitches. It may be unpalatable
                        to many users, but a Web founded on no more than amateur enthusiasm and spare time
                        commitment will never rise to the dizzy heights being mapped for
