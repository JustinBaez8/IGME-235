            Information
        </h2>
        <p> The goal of the site is to explore the connection between the talented artist Simon St√•lenhag and the effect his artwork has had on people.</p>
        <p> To do so, we had to turn an existing magazine layout into a website with navigation. </p>

        <h2>
            Challenges
        </h2>
        <p> The most difficult part was figuring out the layout as the overlapping text and elements that need to be floated makes it difficult to get the sizing correct.</p>
        <p> The navigation can also be difficult as the elements on the page are similarly spaced and the navigation has to work for smaller screens.</p>
        <p> Resizing elements on mobile devices can also be troubling but with the removal of some elements it can work out.</p>
